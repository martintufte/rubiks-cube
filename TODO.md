# TODO

This is a page to track what is being worked on, ideas and finished work

* Backlog:
  * [] Improve MoveMeta: Check if set of moves have parity
  * [] Improve entropy calculation: Sort with lower/upper bounds using excludion-inclusion
  * [] Improve bidirectional solver; solve from rotated state using conjugation
  * [] Improve beam search: Persist inverse frontier

* Ideas:
  * [] Improve pattern generation: eo.fb instead of eo-fb?
  * [] Find boundary of a move sequence
  * [] Improve beam search; candidate variations
  * [] Improve parsing of steps; local updates
  * [] Improve bidirectional solver; add redundant moves (i.e. no visual update to pattern)
  * [] Use TypeScript + FastAPI instead of Streamlit
  * [] Prune actions using heuristics/pruning tables
  * [] Add support for 2x2 - 7x7 in the main app
  * [] Solve using both normal and inverse at the same time
  * [] Improve beam search; subclass/coset heuristics for solving to the next step
  * [] Implement beam stack search (BSS)
  * [] Add algorithm support, e.g. :t-perm:
  * [] Algorithm solver, requires full support for algorithms
  * [] IDA* solver, requires pruning tables
